# Budyko-partitioned cropland product (BPCP)

</div>

<div >

The disaggregated cropland map created by partitioning the HCCM into rainfed and irrigated areas using the crop partitioning framework is shown in [Figure 06](#figure-06--disaggregated-cropland-product-for-africa-showing-irrigated-and-rainfed-areas-as-identified-using-the-budyko-model-a-distinction-is-made-between-cropland-areas-with-blue-et-≥-100-mm-formal-irrigation-and-cropland-areas-with-blue-et-≤-100-mm-supplemental-irrigation), while the confusion matrix generated after comparison with the independent validation dataset is presented in [Table 03](#table-03---confusion-matrix-of-rainfed-and-irrigated-cropland-product-derived-after-partitioning-hccm-using-the-budyko-model). An area of 461,000 km2, which is 19 % of the HCCM cropland area is identified as irrigated. Distinguishing between cropland areas of formal irrigation (i.e., blue ET ≥ 100 mm) and areas with supplemental irrigation in this Budyko-partitioned cropland product (BPCP), it is found that 239,000 km2 (51.9 %) is under formal irrigation. In contrast, the remaining 222,000 km2 can be classified as areas under supplemental irrigation. Large continuous areas where formal irrigation occurs can be found in the North West Coast basin in Morocco, the Nile Valley and Delta in Egypt, and the Nile basin in Sudan. Other notable areas where irrigation occurs include scattered croplands in the Zambezi basin in Malawi and Zambia, the inland delta of the Niger basin in Mali, the Lake Chad basin in north-eastern Nigeria, and South Africa.

Following validation, an overall accuracy of 73 % was obtained. The precision, sensitivity, and specificity values were respectively 92 %, 59 %, and 92 %. Cohen’s Kappa score of 0.48 was also obtained.

The total and intensive irrigated cropland area per country [Figure 08](#figure-08--total-and-formal-irrigated-cropland-area-per-country-for-budyko-partitioned-cropland-product-bpcp-compared-to-faos-aquastat-data-on-actual-irrigated-area-and-area-under-agricultural-water-management-as-well-as-an-irrigated-area-for-wapor-and-lgrip-landcover-products-notation-in-legend-irrig--total-irrigated-area-awm--agricultural-water-management-prod--product) and total for Africa [Table 04](#table-04--total-irrigated-cropland-area-for-africa-for-budyko-partitioned-cropland-product-bpcp-compared-to-faos-aquastat-data-on-actual-irrigated-area-and-area-under-agricultural-water-management-as-well-as-an-irrigated-area-for-wapor-and-lgrip-landcover-products) for the BPCP is presented along with the FAO Aquastat statistics on the irrigated area (only) and areas under AWM. The latter FAO data captures areas under flood recession agriculture and cultivated inland valley bottoms in addition to formal irrigated areas. Additionally, the irrigated areas for the remote-sensing products, WaPOR and Landsat-Derived Global Rainfed and Irrigated-Cropland Product (LGRIP), are also compared. The continental total irrigated area of BPCP (461,000 km2), is larger than the FAO irrigated area (101,000 km2), the area under AWM (196,000 km2), and WaPOR continental irrigated cropland area (275,000 km2). However, the continental total irrigated area of BPCP is comparable to that of LGRIP, which is 494,000 km2. The area under formal irrigation for BPCP in Africa is comparable to the WaPOR irrigated cropland area. Considering the irrigated area per country, Egypt is the only country where all the products agree. For South Africa, the total BPCP irrigated area is similar to both WaPOR and LGRIP.
