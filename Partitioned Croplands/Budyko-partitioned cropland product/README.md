The disaggregated cropland map created by partitioning the HCCM into rainfed and irrigated areas using the crop partitioning framework is shown in [Figure 06](#figure-06--disaggregated-cropland-product-for-africa-showing-irrigated-and-rainfed-areas-as-identified-using-the-budyko-model-a-distinction-is-made-between-cropland-areas-with-blue-et-≥-100-mm-formal-irrigation-and-cropland-areas-with-blue-et-≤-100-mm-supplemental-irrigation), while the confusion matrix generated after comparison with the independent validation dataset is presented in Table 4. An area of 461,000 km2, which is 19 % of the HCCM cropland area is identified as irrigated. Distinguishing between cropland areas of formal irrigation (i.e., blue ET ≥ 100 mm) and areas with supplemental irrigation in this Budyko-partitioned cropland product (BPCP), it is found that 239,000 km2 (51.9 %) is under formal irrigation. In contrast, the remaining 222,000 km2 can be classified as areas under supplemental irrigation. Large continuous areas where formal irrigation occurs can be found in the North West Coast basin in Morocco, the Nile Valley and Delta in Egypt, and the Nile basin in Sudan. Other notable areas where irrigation occurs include scattered croplands in the Zambezi basin in Malawi and Zambia, the inland delta of the Niger basin in Mali, the Lake Chad basin in north-eastern Nigeria, and South Africa.
