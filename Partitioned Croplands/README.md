# Partitioning the Watered Lands: A Framework for Distinguishing Rainfed and Irrigated Croplands at Continental Scale

</div>


## 1. Introduction

- Sustainable agricultural water management (AWM) can be informed by accurate mapping of the location and extent of croplands. However, comparative analyses of many remote-sensing land use and landcover (LULC) products reveals significant disparities in global cropland identification.

- Compounding this issue, many existing products fail to differentiate between rainfed and irrigated agriculture, often aggregating them into a singular cropland category. As a result, it is difficult to identify the different sources of water, whether blue or green water, for their management. 

- Yet, agriculture is the largest consumer of freshwater globally, and therefore, meeting the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of ‚ÄòZero Hunger‚Äô and other associated SDGs, requires an understanding of the pathways, fluxes, and footprints of water in croplands. 

- In this study, a framework incorporating the Budyko model is applied to partition evapotranspiration (ET) into green and blue fluxes and thereby identify rainfed and irrigated croplands in Africa. This cropland partitioning is done using remote sensing precipitation (P), actual and reference ET, and different LULC products for continental Africa. The specific objectives are:

    - To assess the level of agreement between different LULC products for Africa; 
    - To generate an alternative composite cropland map which overcomes the high disagreement and errors inherent in individual crop masks of LULC products;
    - To demonstrate a scalable approach to partition croplands into irrigated and rainfed classes using the Budyko model; and 
    - To apply this approach in partitioning croplands to the individual LULC products and thereby demonstrate its applicability.

<p>The framework incorporates the Budyko model, an empirical representation of a river basin‚Äôs long-term water and energy balance under steady state conditions. Considering available energy  (i.e.: potential evapotranspiration (ùê∏ùëá)),  and water (i.e.: precipitation (ùëÉ)), it is possible to determine ‚Äòexcess‚Äô ET using the Budyko model and thereby identify any additional water input i.e., blue water.
