## 1. Introduction

- Sustainable agricultural water management (AWM) can be informed by accurate mapping of the location and extent of croplands. However, comparative analyses of many remote-sensing land use and landcover (LULC) products reveals significant disparities in global cropland identification.

- Compounding this issue, many existing products fail to differentiate between rainfed and irrigated agriculture, often aggregating them into a singular cropland category. As a result, it is difficult to identify the different sources of water, whether blue or green water, for their management. 

- Yet, agriculture is the largest consumer of freshwater globally, and therefore, meeting the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of ‚ÄòZero Hunger‚Äô and other associated SDGs, requires an understanding of the pathways, fluxes, and footprints of water in croplands. 

- In this study, a framework incorporating the Budyko model is applied to partition evapotranspiration (ET) into green and blue fluxes and thereby identify rainfed and irrigated croplands in Africa. This cropland partitioning is done using remote sensing precipitation (P), actual and reference ET, and different LULC products for continental Africa. The specific objectives are:

    - To assess the level of agreement between different LULC products for Africa; 
    - To generate an alternative composite cropland map which overcomes the high disagreement and errors inherent in individual crop masks of LULC products;
    - To demonstrate a scalable approach to partition croplands into irrigated and rainfed classes using the Budyko model; and 
    - To apply this approach in partitioning croplands to the individual LULC products and thereby demonstrate its applicability.

<p>The framework incorporates the Budyko model, an empirical representation of a river basin‚Äôs long-term water and energy balance under steady state conditions. Considering available energy  (i.e.: potential evapotranspiration (ùê∏ùëá)),  and water (i.e.: precipitation (ùëÉ)), it is possible to determine ‚Äòexcess‚Äô ET using the Budyko model and thereby identify any additional water input i.e., blue water.

- High score of 92% for precision and specificity- Low rate of false positives and therefore framework is accurate when it identifies a cropland pixel as irrigated.

- Low sensitivity - High rate of false negatives whereby some irrigated croplands are being missed and incorrectly labeled as rainfed.

## 5. Conclusions

- The study expands on the products available for detailed agricultural water management and food security studies across Africa, quantifies the disagreement between LULC products and identifies LULC products with accurate cropland classes at continental level following twofold accuracy assessment.

- The framework performs well in disaggregating croplands into irrigated and rainfed areas across Africa, correctly identifying irrigated areas while making few errors in misidentifying rainfed areas as irrigated. 

- Applying it to study changes in cropland area and characteristics, it is found that irrigated cropland area is increasing across Africa (20%), with formal and supplemental irrigation increasing at 26% and 12% respectively since 2013. This has implications for water resources management and governance.
